# CCC (Cline Claude Cost)

Ever wonder if you're overpaying for that $200/month Claude Max subscription? CCC analyzes your actual token usage from Cline VS Code extension logs to show you how much you would have paid if you were using Claude API calls instead. Discover your potential savings!

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.7.0 and above
- VS Code with Cline extension installed
- Some coding history with Cline

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeremysltn/CCC.git
   cd CCC
   ```

2. **Install rich**
   ```bash
   pip install rich
   ```

3. **Run the calculator**
   ```bash
   python CCC.py
   ```

## üéØ CLI Options

- **Check version**: `python CCC.py --version` or `python CCC.py -v`
- **Export to SVG**: `python CCC.py --export-svg` (saves report as SVG file)
